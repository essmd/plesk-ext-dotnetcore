# Extension for .NET Core on Plesk Onyx Linux

## What is this extension and project about?

While there is no official support or extension for .NET Core on Linux in Plesk Onyx yet, i started working on this extension. It should work with Plesk Onyx running on Debian. Maybe i will update it to get it working on other versions of linux too (Ubuntu, CentOS etc.).

## Disclaimer

Since i work on this extension for me and just for fun, i don't garantee for any complete or an always working version. Maybe it will be usable by others too or even replace the need for an offial extension anytime but i don't garantee this will happy at any time :)

## Contribution

I am focused on a version, that runs with Plesk Onyx installed on Debian and i am happy and open for every contribution and help on this project. So if you are interested and motivated to work on this project, add support for other linux version etc. - dont hestitate to open a pull request, you and the pull requests are welcome!
